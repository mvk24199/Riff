/// Apple's `MetricKit` is the built-in crash + hang + perf reporter for
/// macOS 12+. We subscribe at app start; the OS hands us aggregated
/// payloads roughly daily (the system delivers them when convenient,
/// usually on app launch) describing crashes, hangs, disk-write
/// exceptions, and CPU-exception events from the *previous* session.
///
/// Riff's policy: write every payload as JSON under
/// `~/Library/Application Support/Riff/diagnostics/<UTC>.json`. We
/// don't network anything by default — privacy stays intact and the
/// user can read / share the file manually (or we can add an opt-in
/// uploader later). This is enough to catch YT-protocol-break-induced
/// crashes that would otherwise silently lose a user.
///
/// The class is `@MainActor` because `MXMetricManager.shared` is
/// thread-confined and we add ourselves as a subscriber from the main
/// actor; payload delivery itself can hop background threads, so we
/// `dispatch async` back to a fileIO queue for the actual write.
