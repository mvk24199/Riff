/// Generates X-Ray context cards for a song via the user's configured
/// `LLMProvider` (B4). Cards surface lyric references — people, places,
/// events, sample sources, trivia — as a vertical magazine-style stack
/// on the Now Playing pane.
///
/// Architectural notes:
///   - Mirrors `LyricsTranslator` (B3) intentionally: `@MainActor`,
///     in-memory cache keyed by videoId, in-flight task table for
///     coalescing, tolerant JSON-array parser. Two AI flows side by
///     side with the same shape makes the surface easy to reason
///     about.
///   - Cache key is just `videoId` — unlike translation we don't
///     vary by language because the cards summarize trivia in the
///     UI's locale (English) and the user can re-roll by clearing
///     the key. If lyrics arrive late, the first cached result is
///     authoritative; we don't re-fire when lyrics land later since
///     the people / places / era cards are usually answerable from
///     title + artist alone.
///   - The provider is captured via a `@MainActor` factory so a key
///     rotation in Settings takes effect without rebuilding the
///     service.
