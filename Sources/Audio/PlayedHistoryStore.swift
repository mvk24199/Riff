/// 30-day, 90-day, all-time — over the same history the year-end Recap
/// already aggregates.
///
/// Pre-B1 the journal stored `[MediaItem]` directly. We migrate on
/// load: existing entries get `Date.distantPast` so they continue to
/// appear in the "All time" window but are excluded from any bounded
/// window (which is the only honest behaviour — we don't know when they

/// Tiny encapsulation of the locally-persisted played-history journal.
/// Pulled out of `PlayerBridge` (audit §6.8) so the journal lifecycle
/// has one obvious owner. The rest of `PlayerBridge` keeps its own
/// in-memory `playedHistory` array for SwiftUI observation; this type
/// owns the disk side only.
///
/// Writes are eager — every `archive(_:)` synchronously persists.
/// History is small (cap N items) so the encode cost is microseconds
/// and an unexpected crash never loses more than the *current* track.
///
/// **Storage isolation:** `defaults` is injectable. Production uses
/// `.standard`; tests inject a per-suite `UserDefaults(suiteName:)` so
/// fixture data never bleeds into the running app's history. (Found
/// the hard way: a previous version used `.standard` unconditionally,
/// and `xcodebuild test` polluted production defaults with rows like
/// `{title: "T", subtitle: "Artist"}` from test fixtures.)
///
/// **Storage key versioning:** `v3` carries timestamps; the legacy
/// `v2` key stored bare `[MediaItem]`. On first launch after the B1
/// migration, `load()` reads the v2 blob (if present), wraps each item
/// in a `PlayedEntry` with `Date.distantPast`, persists under v3, and
/// removes v2. Future schema changes should bump the version in the
/// same way; UserDefaults supports millions of orphan keys without ill
/// effect, so the abandoned keys are safe to leave.
